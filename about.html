          <br>This website was created by Marcus Hedgecock. One day, he wondered if there were any websites out there that 
          existed which contained a database of racetracks. There are a few websites out there that are like this, but there's 
          hardly any of them. That's why he decided to make a racetrack database himself.<br>
